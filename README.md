# Webform Flag Submissions

A Drupal 7 module that allows users to flag Webform submissions.

This is a fork of https://drupal.org/sandbox/Jackinloadup/1081630

It is not possible to migrate flaggings from the above module to this one, 
since they use different types of IDs for the flaggings. This module's 
solutions is the only one that actually works with Drupal 7.
